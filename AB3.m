function [y,t] = AB3(fun,y0,T,DT,IOSTEP)

%Input:
  %fun: function handle representing f(y, t) 
  %y0: column vector representing the initial condition 
  %T: period of integration 
  %DT: time step 
  %IOSTEP: Input/output step. The solution is saved in the output matrix y 
    %every IOSTEP steps.
%Output:
  %y: n Ã— S matrix collecting the time snapshots of the solution to (2). 
  %Note that the total number of snapshots S (including the initial condition) 
    %is floor(T/(IOSTEP*DT))+1. 
  %t: vector collecting the time instants at which the solution is saved in the 
    %output matrix y.
