function [z0,iter,res,his] = Newton_method(fun,dfun,x0,tol,Nmax)

%Inputs:
% fun: function handle representing f(x) 
% tol: maximum tolerance allowed for the increment |x(k+1) âˆ’ x(k)|
% Nmax: maximum number of iterations allowed 
% dfun: function handle representing df(x)/dx (Newton method) 
% x0: initial guess for the zero (Newton method)

%Outputs:
% z0: approximation of the zero z0 
% iter: number of iterations to obtain z0
% res: residual at z0 (i.e., |f(z0)|) 
% his: vector collecting all the elements of the sequence {x(k)}k=0,1,.. (convergence history)
